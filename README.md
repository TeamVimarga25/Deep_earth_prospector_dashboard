Deep Earth Prospector Platform

We have created a  platform to visualise the results from various ML algorithms for the commodities- Gold/Copper, Diamond and REE.

The platform has been structured in such a way that for a particular commodity, one can import Geophysical, Structural, Geochemical and Aster layers and overlay the results from the five ML algorithms discussed in the report. In addition, the known deposit and mineralisation data from Bhukosh and NGDR can also be uploaded in the form of shapefiles. In the figure above, the solutions from all the five algorithms have been uploaded along with the Hackathon-2 boundary.

In addition to this, grid can be overlaid on the map, and different locations can be searched using the search by coordinate feature. We have also provided the results from 3D modeling achieved through SimPEG modeling.

Users can upload their areas of interest and the results from their models to visualise the results more effectively.
